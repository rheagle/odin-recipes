    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3 cups quick-cooking rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can (1 1/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (12 oz) pkg (2 cups) semisweet chocolate pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>Set aside 2 tbsp of the butter. In a large mixing bowl,
            beat the remaining butter with an electric mixer on medium 
            speed for 30 seconds. Add brown sugar; beat until well mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in 2 eggs and 2 tsp vanilla until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>In another large bowl, stir together flour and baking
            soda until well combined. Stir in oats.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually stir dry mixture into beaten mixture until well
            combined. Set aside and begin working on the chocolate 
            filling.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the reserved butter, the 
            sweetened condensed milk, and the chocolate pieces. Cook over
            low heat until chocolate melts, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the chocolate mix from the heat. Stir in chopped walnuts
            (optional) and the remaining 2 tsp vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>Press two-thirds of the oat mixture into the bottom of an
            ungreased 15x10x1 inch baking pan until flat. Spread the
            melted chocolate mixture over the oat mixture until all of the
            bottom layer is covered with chocolate.
        </li>
        <li>Using your fingers, dot the remaining oat mixture over the
            chocolate.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes or until top is lightly browned.
            The chocolate mixture will still look moist when you take
            it out of the oven. Cool the pan on a wire rack. Cut into
            2x1 inch bars.
        </li>
    </ol>
